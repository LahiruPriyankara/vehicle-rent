# vehicle-rent

This contains two projects. 

One is for backend (vehicle_rent_backend) and other one is for frontend (vehicle_rent_frontend) process. 

Both projects are develop using eclipse IDE. 

VEHICLE_RENT_DATABASE is containing all the SQL files to generate the database which I have used. Database name should be ’vehicle_rent’.(MySql)

I hosted those apps in tomcat 8.


Video demonstrations of the project is available on.
